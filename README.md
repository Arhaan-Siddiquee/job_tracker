# job_tracker

This is a WIP open source project to meet the following objectives:

* Make an app for tracking job applications
* Ensure that each entry can note the following: a job role name, a company name, a start date, an end date, a current status, and a way to create entries related to that application (saved related notes), and an optional link URL

This project is part of Hacktoberfest 2024. All are welcome to work on issues and join in!
